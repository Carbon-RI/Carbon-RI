Hi there 👋

# Aspiring Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead 🚀

### About Me

I am a passionate aspiring **Full-Stack Developer** currently mastering modern web technologies at **Langara College**.

My background includes **15 years of construction project management**, where I built a robust foundation in delivering complex projects—particularly large-scale **data centers**—from conception to completion. This experience has honed my abilities in:
* **Project Oversight:** Managing complex timelines and scope.
* **Global Team Collaboration:** Successfully leading diverse, multinational teams in Japan and Singapore.

My enthusiasm for **problem-solving** fueled my pivot to software engineering. I am deeply focused on developing with **JavaScript, React, and Node.js**, and I aim to leverage my seasoned project management and team collaboration skills to architect and deliver innovative software solutions.

Let's connect and build something impactful!

### 🚀 Featured Project:

###Dosis (Medication Management App)

**Concept:** Dosis is a mobile application designed to seamlessly integrate medication taking into the user's daily life, minimizing cognitive load and effort.

* **Key Features:**
    * One-step schedule registration based on user rhythm and medication requirements.
    * Comprehensive Push Notifications (including refill timing).
    * Interaction Blocker during medication addition for focused registration.

#### 🛠️ Technology Used

| Category | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Front/Mobile** | **ReactNative (Expo)** |
| **Back-end** | **Node.js, Express** |
| **Auxiliary** | **Python** (for OCR assistance) |
| **Database** | **MongoDB** (integrated with Agenda for scheduling) |

#### 👤 My Responsibilities (Core Focus)

* **Architectural Design:** Designing the core logic for medication registration, schedule generation, and notification features.
* **Data Modeling:** Designing the database schema and data modeling strategy.
* **Implementation:** Implementing core registration features, including OCR functionality.
* **Refactoring:** Overall code refactoring and system integration.

#### 💡 Challenges & Solutions

1.  **Safety & Scalability (MedTech Perspective):**
    * **Challenge:** As a MedTech app, we required a secure and realistic specification that could adapt to long-term changes (e.g., official drug API integration).
    * **Solution:** Developed a long-term plan with defined phases. Architected the data source to allow seamless switching from the self-maintained DB to an external DB, and eventually to an API, **without major core logic rework**.

2.  **Usability vs. Flexibility (PM Perspective):**
    * **Challenge:** Balancing the attractiveness of flexible feature expansion against the risk of creating overly complex settings, which would increase the learning curve and decrease manageability for users.
    * **Solution:** Prioritized releasing a basic set of features first to validate the app's core concept and philosophy against market needs before introducing complex, optional flexibility.
