Hi there 👋

# Aspiring Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead 🚀

### About Me

I am a passionate aspiring **Full-Stack Developer** currently mastering modern web technologies at **Langara College**.

My background includes **15 years of construction project management**, where I built a robust foundation in delivering complex projects—particularly large-scale **data centers**—from conception to completion. This experience has honed my abilities in:
* **Project Oversight:** Managing complex timelines and scope.
* **Global Team Collaboration:** Successfully leading diverse, multinational teams in Japan and Singapore.

My enthusiasm for **problem-solving** fueled my pivot to software engineering. I am deeply focused on developing with **JavaScript, React, and Node.js**, and I aim to leverage my seasoned project management and team collaboration skills to architect and deliver innovative software solutions.

Let's connect and build something impactful!
